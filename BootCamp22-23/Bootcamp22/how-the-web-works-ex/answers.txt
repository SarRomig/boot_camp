What are the processes that happen when you type “http://somesite.com/some/page.html” into a browser?
    The DNS turns the site name into an IP Address, the browser connects to the server on a port, asking for some page or information along with a query string to provide more context, that is sent to the server then the server processes the request within itself or by going to a database and then send a response to the browser with the results of the request.
